# chip8
A C++ Chip-8 Interpreter that provides graphical output via SDL and emulates the 35 standard opcodes. Graphical rendering works but many opcodes are currently buggy, making many games unplayable. Input is mapped directly via the keyboard (key-for-key rather than using a QWE-ASD-ZXC or another type of layout). If you want to learn more about the platform, read this [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) article.
